## 1. Primary Risk Rate Premiums (Original Rates)

This rate structure applies to both **Owner's** and **Mortgage (Lender's)** title insurance policies. Premiums are calculated on a tiered "per thousand" basis; any fraction of $100.00 is rounded up to the next full $100.00.

| Liability Amount | Rate per $1,000 | Min. Insurer Retention |
|---|---|---|
| First $0 to $100,000 | $5.75 | 30% |
| $100,000 to $1,000,000 | Add $5.00 | 30% |
| $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 | Add $2.50 | 35% |
| $5,000,000 to $10,000,000 | Add $2.25 | 40% |
| Over $10,000,000 | Add $2.00 | 40% |

* **Minimum Premium:** $100.00 for all standard conveyances.
* **Simultaneous Issue:** When an owner's and a mortgage policy covering identical land are issued simultaneously, the owner's policy is charged the regular rate. The mortgage policy is a minimum of **$25.00** for any amount up to the owner's policy limit. Any mortgage amount in excess of the owner's policy is charged at regular mortgage rates.
* **Policy Amount Rules:** Owner's policies must be for the full insurable value. Mortgage policies must be for at least the full principal debt, but may be issued for up to 125% of that debt to cover interest and foreclosure costs.

## 2. Reissue Rates

Reissue rates apply to **Owner's** and **Mortgage** policies if a prior owner's policy was issued to the seller or mortgagor. This applies to unimproved property, policies issued less than 3 years after the prior policy, or mortgage policies on a refinance of property insured by an original owner's policy.

| Reissue Liability Amount | Rate per $1,000 |
|---|---|
| Up to $100,000 | $3.30 |
| $100,000 to $1,000,000 | Add $3.00 |
| $1,000,000 to $10,000,000 | Add $2.00 |
| Over $10,000,000 | Add $1.50 |

* **Minimum Premium:** The minimum reissue premium is $100.00.
* **Excess Liability Rule:** Any amount of new insurance in excess of the amount under the previous policy must be computed at the original rates provided in Section 1.

## 3. Simultaneous Issue Rules

* **Owner's + Mortgage Policy:** Pay the full Owner's rate plus a minimum $25.00 for the loan policy (if the loan amount is ≤ the owner's policy). Any loan amount in excess is charged at regular mortgage rates.
* **Owner's + Leasehold Policy:** Pay the full Owner's rate plus 30% of the owner's rate for the leasehold policy (up to the owner's policy amount).

## 4. Endorsement Fee Schedule

The risk rate premium for each endorsement must be itemized on the closing statement. For **simultaneously issued** mortgage policies, the 10% endorsement charge is based on the sum of the premiums for the owner's and loan policy to which it applies.
