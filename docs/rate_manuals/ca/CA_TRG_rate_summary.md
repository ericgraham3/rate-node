| Policy Type | Rate | Minimum Premium | Description |
|------------|------|-----------------|-------------|
| **CLTA Standard Coverage Policy** | 100% of Schedule | $609 | Basic coverage with standard exceptions |
| **ALTA Owner's Policy (with Western Regional Exceptions)** | 100% of Schedule | $609 | ALTA form with WRE |

## Binder Structure (Hold-Open Policy)

### What is a Binder?

California uses **"Binders"** for hold-open/prepaid final policy structures. This is functionally identical to "Hold-Open" or "Prepaid Final Policy" in other states.

**Purpose:** Designed for house flipping, relocation companies, and investors who plan to resell property within a specified timeframe.

### How It Works

#### Step 1: Initial Purchase (Opendoor buys from seller)
1. **Owner's Policy Issued:** Full premium at applicable rate (Standard, Extended, or Homeowner's)
2. **Binder Fee Added:** 10% of Schedule of Rates based on anticipated resale value
3. **Total Cost:** Owner's Policy Premium + Binder Fee
4. **Timeframe:** Binder valid for 24 months from closing

#### Step 2: Resale (Opendoor sells to ultimate purchaser)
1. **Credit Applied:** Full amount of original Owner's Policy premium (Binder fee is NOT credited)
2. **Additional Premium:** Only if resale price exceeds original policy amount (increased liability)
3. **No Additional Charge:** If resale is for same or lower amount within 24 months

### Binder Extensions

| Extension Type | Cost | Maximum Timeframe |
|----------------|------|-------------------|
| First Extension | 10% of Schedule (based on policy amount) | Additional 12 months |
| Second Extension | 10% of Schedule (based on policy amount) | Additional 12 months (48 months total) |

### Detailed Example Calculation

**Scenario:** Opendoor buys house for $400,000, plans to resell for estimated $450,000

#### Initial Purchase:
```
Purchase Price: $400,000
Owner's Policy (Standard): $1,372 (100% of Schedule)
Binder Fee (10% of $450,000): $148.20
Total at Initial Purchase: $1,520.20
```

#### Resale Scenario 1 - Sale at $450,000 (within 24 months):
```
Resale Price: $450,000
Credit from Original Policy: -$1,372
Additional Premium (increased liability): $110
(Difference between $450k schedule [$1,482] and $400k schedule [$1,372])
Total at Resale: $110
```

#### Resale Scenario 2 - Sale at $380,000 (within 24 months):
```
Resale Price: $380,000
Credit from Original Policy: -$1,372
New Policy Premium: $1,337
Additional Premium: $0 (credit exceeds new premium)
Total at Resale: $0
```

#### Resale Scenario 3 - Sale after 24 months (extension required):
```
Extension Fee (paid before 24 months expire): $148.20 (10% of $400k)
Extended Timeframe: 36 months total
Credit at Resale: -$1,372
Additional Premium: Based on increased liability (if any)
```

## Loan Policies - Without Concurrent Owner's Policy

When NO owner's policy is issued concurrently:

| Policy Type | Rate | Minimum Premium | Form Numbers |
|------------|------|-----------------|--------------|
| **CLTA Standard Coverage (with WRE)** | 80% of Schedule | $487.20 | CLTA, ALTA with WRE |
| **ALTA Extended Coverage (without WRE)** | 90% of Schedule | $548.10 | ALTA without WRE |
| **ALTA Expanded Coverage Residential** | 100% of Schedule | $609 | ALTA Expanded |

### Calculation Notes
- Base rate on loan amount OR fair market value, whichever is LESS
- If loan amount exceeds property value, still use property value for rate calculation

---

## Loan Policies - With Concurrent Owner's Policy

### Standard Coverage Loan Policy (Concurrent)

| Owner's Policy Type | Loan Policy Rate | Notes |
|---------------------|------------------|-------|
| Standard Coverage | $150 flat fee | For loan amounts up to owner's policy amount |
| Extended Coverage | $150 flat fee | For loan amounts up to owner's policy amount |
| Homeowner's Policy | $150 flat fee | For loan amounts up to owner's policy amount |
| Binder | $150 flat fee | For loan amounts up to binder amount |

**For loan amounts EXCEEDING owner's policy amount:**
- Calculate increased liability: Difference between Schedule charge at loan amount vs. owner's policy amount
- Apply 80% rate to the increased liability portion
- Add $150 base fee

### Extended Coverage Loan Policy (Concurrent with Standard Owner's)

| Owner's Policy Type | Loan Policy Rate |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Standard Coverage | 100% of Extended Lenders Concurrent Rate* |
| Homeowner's Policy | 100% of Extended Lenders Concurrent Rate* |
| Binder | 100% of Extended Lenders Concurrent Rate* |

*Extended Lenders Concurrent Rate shown in rate schedule (separate column)

**Minimum:** Lowest charge on rate schedule

### Extended Coverage Loan Policy (Concurrent with Extended Owner's)

| Coverage | Rate |
|----------|------|
| Up to owner's policy amount | $150 flat fee |
| Exceeding owner's policy amount | Increased liability at applicable rate |

### ALTA Expanded Coverage Residential Loan Policy

| Owner's Policy Type | Loan Policy Rate |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Standard, Homeowner's, or Binder | Extended Lenders Concurrent Rate + 10% of Schedule |
| Extended Coverage | $150 flat fee (up to owner's policy amount) |

### Multiple Loan Policies

**When 2+ loan policies are issued to same borrower on same property:**
- Calculate aggregate loan amount
- Charge applicable rate on aggregate
- Add $150 for each loan policy beyond the first

**Example:**
- First mortgage: $300,000
- Second mortgage: $50,000
- Total: $350,000
- Charge: Rate on $350,000 + $150 for second policy
