## Binder Structure (Hold-Open Policy)

### What is a Binder?

ORT California uses **"Binder or Commitment to Insure a Resale"** for hold-open/prepaid final policy structures. This is functionally identical to "Hold-Open" or "Prepaid Final Policy" in other states.

**Purpose:** Designed for house flipping, relocation companies, and investors who plan to resell property within a specified timeframe.

**Manual Reference:** Section 1.2 (Residential Properties) and Section 3.3 (Commercial Properties)

### How It Works - Residential Properties

#### Step 1: Initial Purchase (Opendoor buys from seller)
1. **Owner's Policy Premium:** Full premium at applicable rate
2. **Binder Fee Added:** 10% of OR Insurance Rate based on full value
3. **Total Cost:** Owner's Policy Premium + Binder Fee
4. **Timeframe:** Binder valid for 24 months (2 years) from recordation date

#### Detailed Binder Charges by Coverage Type:

| Coverage Type | Owner's Policy Rate | Binder Fee | Total at Initial Purchase |
|---------------|---------------------|------------|---------------------------|
| **Standard Coverage** | 100% of OR Rate | 10% of OR Rate | 110% of OR Rate |
| **Homeowner's Policy** | 110% of OR Rate | 10% of OR Rate | 120% of OR Rate |
| **Extended Coverage** | 125% of OR Rate | 10% of OR Rate | 135% of OR Rate |

**Formula Breakdown (Standard Coverage Example):**
```
Total Binder Charge = (100% base charge) + (10% binder fee)
Both calculated on the full value of the estate/interest covered
```

#### Step 2: Resale (Opendoor sells to ultimate purchaser)
1. **Credit Applied:** Full amount of "base charge" from original binder
2. **No Credit For:** The 10% binder fee
3. **Additional Premium:** Only if resale amount exceeds original OR if different coverage type requested
4. **No Additional Charge:** If resale is for same or lower amount with same coverage type within 24 months

### Binder Extensions

| Extension Type | Cost | Maximum Timeframe |
|----------------|------|-------------------|
| First Extension | 10% of OR Insurance Rate (based on binder amount) | Additional 12 months (36 months total) |

**Note:** Unlike TRG which allows two 12-month extensions, ORT allows only ONE 12-month extension.

### Interim Transfer Before Ultimate Resale

A binder may be reissued to reflect an interim transfer of title prior to ultimate resale:
- **Charge:** 25% of OR Insurance Rate based on full binder amount
- Plus any charges for increased liability or coverage type changes

### Detailed Example Calculations

**Scenario:** Opendoor buys house for $400,000, plans to resell for estimated $450,000

#### Initial Purchase - Standard Coverage:
```
Purchase Price: $400,000
Owner's Policy (100% of OR Rate): $1,390
Binder Fee (10% of OR Rate at $450,000): $150
Total at Initial Purchase: $1,540
```

#### Initial Purchase - Homeowner's Policy:
```
Purchase Price: $400,000
Owner's Policy (110% of OR Rate): $1,529
Binder Fee (10% of OR Rate at $450,000): $150
Total at Initial Purchase: $1,679
```

#### Resale Scenario 1 - Sale at $450,000 (within 24 months, Standard Coverage):
```
Resale Price: $450,000
Credit from Original Policy: -$1,390 (100% base charge only)
New Policy Premium (100% at $450k): $1,500
Additional Premium: $110
Total at Resale: $110
```

#### Resale Scenario 2 - Sale at $380,000 (within 24 months, Standard Coverage):
```
Resale Price: $380,000
Credit from Original Policy: -$1,390
New Policy Premium (100% at $380k): $1,372
Additional Premium: $0 (credit exceeds new premium)
Total at Resale: $0
```

#### Resale Scenario 3 - Coverage Type Change (Standard → Extended):
```
Original Binder: Standard Coverage at $400,000
  - Base charge paid: $1,390 (100%)
  - Binder fee paid: $139 (10%)
  
Resale at $400,000 with Extended Coverage:
  - New policy cost: $1,737.50 (125% of OR Rate)
  - Credit: -$1,390 (base charge only)
  - Additional charge: $347.50
  
Calculation: $1,737.50 (new Extended) - $1,390 (base paid) = $347.50
```

#### Resale Scenario 4 - Extension Required (after 24 months):
```
Extension Fee (paid before 24 months expire):
  - 10% of OR Rate at $450,000 = $150
  
Extended Timeframe: 36 months total (24 + 12)
Credit at Resale: -$1,390 (base charge)
Additional Premium: Based on increased liability (if any)
```

### Important Binder Rules

✅ **Included in Credit:**
- Full "base charge" of Owner's Policy premium (100%, 110%, or 125% depending on coverage type)

❌ **NOT Included in Credit:**
- Binder fee (10%)
- Extension fees
- Any endorsement charges

🕐 **Timing:**
- Binder expires 24 months from recordation date
- ONE extension available for 12 additional months (36 months max)
- Extensions must be paid BEFORE expiration
- Policy must be issued to ultimate purchaser

📋 **Coverage Type Changes:**
- If original binder was Standard → new policy can be Standard (credit applies) or Extended (pay difference)
- If original binder was Extended → new policy must be Extended for full credit
- Additional charge = difference between new policy cost and base charge paid

### Concurrent Loan at Initial Purchase or Binder Reissuance

When a loan is made simultaneously with issuance or reissuance of a binder:
- Price under the concurrent financing rates in Section 2.1
- Standard Coverage Loan concurrent with any owner's policy: $150
- Extended Coverage Loan rates vary by owner's policy type (see Loan Policies section below)

## Endorsements

### How to Use Endorsement Tables

**Rate Basis:**
- Percentages are based on "OR Insurance Rate" (100% owner's policy rate) at policy amount
- Fixed dollar amounts are shown as-is
- "Std." = Standard Coverage; "Ext." = Extended Coverage

**Form Numbers:**
- CLTA = California Land Title Association
- ALTA = American Land Title Association
- ORT = Old Republic Title (proprietary forms)

**Simultaneous Issue Rule:**
- When owner's and loan policies are issued simultaneously
- Both same type (both Standard or both Extended)
- Both need same endorsement
- Charge only ONCE under the owner's policy
- Provided loan amount ≤ owner's policy amount
