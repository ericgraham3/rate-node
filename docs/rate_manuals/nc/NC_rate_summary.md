## PR-4. Simultaneous Issue of Owner's and Loan Policies

### Rate Structure

When issuing an Owner's Policy and one or more Loan Policies simultaneously on **Identical Property**:

1. Calculate single Policy Premium based on the **higher of**:
   - Owner's Policy coverage amount, OR
   - Total of all Loan Policy coverage amounts

2. Add **$28.50 Simultaneous Issue Premium** for EACH Loan Policy issued

**Note:** The effective dates do not have to be the same, but it must have been possible for both policies to be issued on the same day.

### Example 1: Owner's Policy Higher than Loan

- Owner's Policy: $400,000
- First Loan Policy: $320,000 (80% LTV)

**Calculation:**
- Base premium on $400,000 (higher amount): $820.50
- Simultaneous Issue charge: $28.50
- **Total Premium = $849.00**

### Example 2: Multiple Loans Higher than Owner's

- Owner's Policy: $400,000
- First Loan Policy: $300,000
- Second Loan Policy: $150,000
- Total Loan Coverage: $450,000

**Calculation:**
- Base premium on $450,000 (higher amount): $958.00
- Simultaneous Issue charges: $28.50 × 2 = $57.00
- **Total Premium = $1,015.00**

### Example 3: With Homeowner's Policy

- ALTA Homeowner's Policy: $400,000 (120% rate)
- Standard Loan Policy: $320,000

**Calculation:**
- Base premium on $400,000: $820.50
- Homeowner's 20% surcharge: $164.10
- Simultaneous Issue charge: $28.50
- **Total Premium = $1,013.10**

## PR-5. Reissue Rates ⭐ KEY FEATURE

### Eligibility

A **Prior Policy** must have been issued on **Identical Property** within **15 years** of the new policy date.

**Prior Policy:** An effective policy that describes all or a portion of the land described in the new policy.

**Required Documentation:** The Prior Policy or HUD-1 must be provided to the Insurer to receive the Reissue Rate.

### Rate Structure

- **50% of Regular Rate** up to the amount of the Prior Policy
- **Regular Rate** applies to coverage amounts exceeding the Prior Policy

### Example 1: New Policy Same Amount as Prior Policy

**Prior Policy (issued 3 years ago):** $300,000  
**New Owner's Policy:** $300,000

**Calculation:**
- First $100,000 × $2.78 × 50% = $139.00
- Next $200,000 × $2.17 × 50% = $217.00
- **Total Premium = $356.00**
- *Savings vs Regular Rate: $356.00 (50% discount on entire amount)*

### Example 2: New Policy Higher than Prior Policy

**Prior Policy (issued 5 years ago):** $250,000  
**New Owner's Policy:** $400,000

**Calculation:**
- First $100,000 × $2.78 × 50% = $139.00
- Next $150,000 × $2.17 × 50% = $162.75
- Next $150,000 × $2.17 × 100% (excess over prior) = $325.50
- **Total Premium = $627.25**
- *Regular Rate would be: $820.50 | Savings: $193.25*

### Example 3: Simultaneous Issue with Reissue Rate

**Prior Policy (issued 2 years ago):** $300,000  
**New Owner's Policy:** $350,000  
**New Loan Policy:** $280,000

**Calculation:**
- Base on higher amount: $350,000
- First $100,000 × $2.78 × 50% = $139.00
- Next $200,000 × $2.17 × 50% = $217.00
- Next $50,000 × $2.17 × 100% (excess over prior) = $108.50
- Subtotal: $464.50
- Simultaneous Issue charge: $28.50
- **Total Premium = $493.00**
- *Regular simultaneous rate would be: $849.00 | Savings: $356.00*

### Example 4: Subdivider/Developer/Builder Reissue

**Prior Policy on Parent Tract (issued 4 years ago):** $2,000,000 for 20-lot subdivision  
**New Owner's Policy on Individual Lot:** Sales price $180,000

**Calculation:**
- 50% of Regular Rate up to $180,000 (sales price)
- First $100,000 × $2.78 × 50% = $139.00
- Next $80,000 × $2.17 × 50% = $86.80
- **Total Premium = $225.80**

**Required Documentation:** Prior Policy or HUD-1 must be provided
