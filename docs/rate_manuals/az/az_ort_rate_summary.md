## Hold-Open Policy Structure (Section 2.2.B - "Prepaid Final Policy")

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: This is ORT's "Prepaid Final Policy" which is functionally identical to TRG's "Hold-Open" policy. It serves the same business purpose for the Opendoor flip model.

**Applies to**: Initial purchase with intent to sell to an ultimate purchaser within 12 months (extendable to 24 months).

### Initial Purchase (First Acquisition)
- **Standard Coverage Premium**: 25% of Basic Rate based on initial purchase amount
- **Extended Coverage Premium**: 35% of Basic Rate based on initial purchase amount
- **Duration**: 12 months from date of first policy

### Extension Option (if needed before expiration)
- **Additional 12 Months - Standard Coverage**: Additional 10% of Basic Rate
- **Additional 12 Months - Extended Coverage**: Additional 15% of Basic Rate

### Resale to Ultimate Purchaser (within valid period)
- **Premium**: No additional cost for the same type of policy up to the original amount
- **Increased Liability**: If new sale price exceeds original amount, charge applicable rate (100%, 110%, or 150% of Basic Rate) for the excess amount only
- **Policy Type Upgrade**: Additional charges apply if upgrading from Standard to Homeowner's (add 10% of Basic Rate) or to Extended (add 50% of Basic Rate)

**Example**:
```
First Acquisition (Opendoor purchase):
- Liability: $300,000
- Policy Type: Standard Coverage
- Initial Premium: 25% of Basic Rate = $381
- Total Paid at Purchase: $381

Ultimate Purchaser (Opendoor sale within 12 months):
- Liability: $400,000
- Policy Type: Standard Coverage
- Premium for increase: 100% of Basic Rate on $100,000 excess = $830
- Net Premium Due: $830 (no charge for first $300,000)

If Extended to 24 months before expiration:
- Additional fee: 10% of Basic Rate on $300,000 = $153
- Total paid before ultimate sale: $381 + $153 = $534
```

**Important Notes**:
1. Premium for final policy must be paid at time of first acquisition
2. If upgrading to Homeowner's Policy: Add 10% of Basic Rate on full new amount
3. If upgrading to Extended Coverage: Add 50% of Basic Rate on full new amount
4. Concurrent lender's insurance on final sale: Charged at applicable rate (Section 3.2)
5. Amount of owner's insurance must equal or exceed new loan amount plus any existing liens OR the Fair Value of the property
