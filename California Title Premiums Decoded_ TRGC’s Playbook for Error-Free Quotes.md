# California Title Premiums Decoded: TRGC’s Playbook for Error-Free Quotes

## Executive Summary

Calculating title insurance premiums in California under Title Resources Guaranty Company (TRGC) is a multi-step process governed by a detailed rate manual filed with the California Department of Insurance. [calculation_summary[0]][1] While the process begins with a standard formula—multiplying a base rate by a policy-specific percentage—mastery lies in navigating the numerous special rates, concurrent-issue discounts, and compliance rules that can swing a final quote by over 60%. This report provides a comprehensive guide to TRGC's California rate structure, effective September 1, 2025, transforming the complex manual into an actionable playbook for generating accurate, compliant, and profitable quotes. [calculation_summary[0]][1]

### The "10K-Up" Rounding Rule Creates Hidden Price Swings
A core principle of the TRGC manual is that any fractional amount of insurance liability must be rounded up to the next $10,000 increment before rate lookup. [calculation_summary[0]][1] This means even a single dollar crossing a $10,000 threshold can trigger a significant premium increase. For example, on liabilities over $3M, this jump adds approximately $5.25 to the owner's premium. [schedule_of_rates_tables[0]][1] Failing to apply this rounding rule early and consistently is a primary source of quoting errors, leading to undercharges or difficult client conversations.

### Concurrent Loan Policies Offer the Single Biggest Discount
The most significant cost-saving opportunity is bundling an owner's and lender's policy in a concurrent issuance. [calculation_summary[0]][1] For instance, a standalone $750,000 extended loan policy would have a premium based on 90% of the schedule rate, while issuing it concurrently with a $500,000 owner's policy reduces the cost to a $150 flat fee plus a charge for the increased liability, a potential savings of over 60%. [lenders_policy_premium_rules[0]][2] This makes bundling the most powerful lever for delivering competitive quotes.

### Special Rate Tables for Refinance & Centralized Loans Can Cut Premiums by 50-70%
Standard rate calculations do not apply to many common residential loan scenarios. The manual includes specific, lower-cost rate tables for Residential Refinances and Centralized Loans. [calculation_summary[0]][1] A $400,000 refinance, for example, costs a flat $850 under the special table, compared to what could be over $1,500 using standard extended loan rates. [lenders_policy_premium_rules[0]][2] Correctly identifying and documenting eligibility for these special rates is critical for both competitiveness and audit compliance.

### Construction Loan Reissue Rates Are a Margin Minefield
Construction-related premiums are complex, with significant discounts available for reissuing a construction policy into permanent financing. However, these discounts are time-sensitive, typically expiring within two years of work completion. [construction_related_premium_rules[0]][1] Missing this window forfeits savings that can be as high as 65% of the standard rate. Furthermore, the rate itself varies dramatically (from 25% to 50% of the Schedule of Rates) depending on whether the coverage type changes from standard to extended. [construction_related_premium_rules[0]][1]

### Major Project Thresholds Trigger Negotiable Pricing and Heightened Compliance
Once a transaction's liability reaches **$2,000,000** (single policy) or **$3,000,000** (aggregate), it falls under Major Project rules, shifting from standard rates to a "per $1,000" calculation. [major_projects_and_subdivision_pricing[0]][2] For deals aggregating **$20,000,000** or more, pricing for title and escrow becomes negotiable, but this deviation from filed rates requires prior written approval from Company Underwriting Counsel, creating a significant compliance checkpoint. [major_projects_and_subdivision_pricing[0]][2]

### Non-Premium Fees Add a Significant, Often Overlooked, Layer to the Final Invoice
The final bill to the consumer includes not only the insurance premium but also a schedule of transactional and escrow fees. [calculation_summary[0]][1] These can include charges for electronic recording ($25), reconveyance ($45), additional parcels ($75), and a tiered schedule of escrow service fees. [calculation_summary[0]][1] These non-premium fees can add a substantial amount to the final invoice and must be itemized clearly to ensure transparency and mitigate consumer complaints.

### Audit Failures Cluster Around "Fair Value" and Documentation
A primary compliance risk is insuring a property for more than its "fair value" without prior TRGC approval. [general_principles_and_rules.fair_value_determination[0]][1] Fair value is strictly defined as the sale price or, if no sale, the total of recorded monetary encumbrances. [general_principles_and_rules.fair_value_determination[0]][1] Similarly, applying special rates (like Centralized Loan or Major Project rates) or waiving fees (like for a Preliminary Report) requires documented proof of eligibility and, in some cases, explicit underwriter approval. [compliance_and_operations_checklist[0]][1]

## 1. Fast-Track Overview — The 9-Step Calculation Path

Calculating a TRGC title insurance premium in California is a sequential process governed by the 'TITLE INSURANCE RATES AND RULES MANUAL FOR CALIFORNIA (All Counties),' effective for applications received on or after September 1, 2025. [calculation_summary[0]][1] The workflow moves from establishing the base liability to layering policy-specific rates, endorsements, and finally, non-premium transactional fees.

The core calculation path is as follows:
1. **Determine Liability Amount**: Establish the property's 'fair value'—typically the sale price. [calculation_summary[0]][1]
2. **Round Up Liability**: Round the liability amount up to the next $10,000 increment. [calculation_summary[0]][1]
3. **Find Base Premium**: Use the rounded liability to find the base premium from the 'Schedule of Rates' in Chapter IX. [calculation_summary[0]][1]
4. **Apply Policy Multiplier**: Adjust the base premium by the correct percentage for the specific policy type (e.g., 100% for standard owner's, 125% for extended owner's, 80% for standalone standard loan). [calculation_summary[0]][1]
5. **Check for Special Rates**: If applicable, use alternative rate tables for scenarios like Residential Refinance, Centralized Loans, or Major Projects, which override the standard calculation. [calculation_summary[0]][1]
6. **Add Endorsement Charges**: Sum the fees for all requested endorsements, which may be flat fees or percentages of the base rate. [calculation_summary[0]][1]
7. **Calculate Total Premium**: Sum all premium-related charges. [calculation_summary[0]][1]
8. **Apply Final Rounding**: Round the final, total premium up to the nearest whole dollar. [calculation_summary[0]][1]
9. **Add Non-Premium Fees**: Add all separate transactional fees, such as escrow, electronic recording ($25), and reconveyance ($45), to arrive at the total client invoice. [calculation_summary[0]][1]

## 2. Liability & Rounding Foundations — Where Most Errors Begin

The foundation of any premium calculation is the correct determination of the liability amount and the strict application of rounding rules. Errors in these initial steps will cascade through all subsequent calculations, leading to incorrect and non-compliant quotes.

### Liability Determination: The "Fair Value" Mandate
The amount of insurance must not be less than the 'Fair Value' of the property. [general_principles_and_rules.fair_value_determination[0]][1] The manual provides a clear hierarchy for this determination:
* **In a Sale:** Fair Value is the **sale price** of the property. [general_principles_and_rules.fair_value_determination[0]][1]
* **No Sale Involved:** Fair Value is determined from all available information, but it can **never be less than the sum of all recorded voluntary monetary encumbrances**. [general_principles_and_rules.fair_value_determination[0]][1]

Crucially, any request to insure a property for an amount exceeding its determined Fair Value requires prior written approval from TRGC. [general_principles_and_rules.fair_value_determination[0]][1]

### The Three-Tier Rounding Workflow
The TRGC manual specifies a precise, multi-step rounding convention that must be followed. [general_principles_and_rules.rounding_conventions[0]][1]
1. **Liability Rounding**: Before consulting any rate table, the total insurance liability amount must be rounded **up** to the next whole $10,000 increment. [general_principles_and_rules.rounding_conventions[0]][1]
 * *Example*: A sale price of $550,001 becomes a liability of $560,000 for rate lookup.
2. **Percentage Rounding**: Whenever a calculation uses a percentage of a rate (common for endorsements or certain policy types), the resulting dollar amount must be rounded **up** to the next whole dollar. [general_principles_and_rules.rounding_conventions[0]][1]
3. **Final Premium Rounding**: If a quote involves multiple calculations (e.g., base premium + endorsement fee), only the **final, summed result** is rounded up to the nearest whole dollar. [step_by_step_calculation_guide[0]][1]

### Minimum Charge Guardrails
Every policy is subject to a minimum charge. This floor is the lowest amount stated on the 'Schedule of Rates' in Chapter IX, unless a different, specific minimum is explicitly defined for a particular product or scenario elsewhere in the manual. [general_principles_and_rules.minimum_charge_rule[0]][1]

## 3. Owner Policy Pricing Matrix — 4 Coverage Tiers, 3 Special Rules

Premiums for Owner's Policies are calculated by applying a specific multiplier to the base rate found in the 'Schedule of Rates' (Chapter IX). [owners_policy_premium_rules[0]][1] The multiplier depends on the level of coverage requested.

### Standard & Homeowner's vs. Extended Coverage
There are four primary tiers for owner's policies, each with a distinct rate multiplier. [owners_policy_premium_rules[2]][3]

| Policy Type | Coverage Details | Rate Multiplier |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CLTA Standard Coverage** | Basic coverage policy. | 100% of Schedule of Rates [owners_policy_premium_rules[2]][3] |
| **ALTA with WRE** | ALTA Owner's Policy with Western Regional Exceptions. | 100% of Schedule of Rates [owners_policy_premium_rules[2]][3] |
| **CLTA/ALTA Homeowner's Policy** | A broader homeowner-specific policy form. | 110% of Schedule of Rates |
| **ALTA without WRE** | ALTA Owner's Policy without Western Regional Exceptions (Extended Coverage). | 125% of Schedule of Rates [owners_policy_premium_rules[2]][3] |

**Key Takeaway**: Choosing an extended coverage policy without regional exceptions (ALTA without WRE) increases the base premium by 25%, while the popular Homeowner's Policy carries a 10% surcharge over the standard rate.

### Special Scenarios: Binders and D.V.A. Transactions

#### Bind-Now, Sell-Later: The 10% Binder Rule
A binder can be issued to insure a future purchaser on a single resale of the property. [owners_policy_premium_rules[2]][3]
* **Initial Charge**: For a 24-month binder, the charge is **10% of the applicable owner's policy rate**, paid in addition to the full premium for the initial Owner's Policy. Both must be paid before the binder is issued. [owners_policy_premium_rules[2]][3]
* **Extensions**: The binder can be extended for two additional 12-month periods, with each extension costing another **10% of the applicable rate**. [owners_policy_premium_rules[2]][3]
* **Increased Liability**: If the final policy issued to the new buyer has a higher liability than the binder, the additional coverage is charged at the standard rate. [owners_policy_premium_rules[0]][1]

#### D.V.A. Transactions and Reconveyance
The manual provides specific rates for transactions involving the Department of Veteran's Affairs (D.V.A.). [owners_policy_premium_rules[2]][3]
* **Acquisition by D.V.A.**: When a veteran conveys title to the D.V.A., the premium is the full applicable rate (100%-125%) based on the D.V.A. contract amount. 
* **Reconveyance to Veteran**: When the D.V.A. reconveys the property back to the original veteran owner, the rate depends on prior coverage:
 * With an existing TRGC Owner's Policy: **25% of the applicable rate**. [owners_policy_premium_rules[2]][3]
 * Without an existing TRGC Owner's Policy: **100% of the applicable rate**. [owners_policy_premium_rules[0]][1]
* **Increased Liability**: Any insurance amount on the reconveyance policy that exceeds the original policy's liability is charged on an Increased Liability Basis. [owners_policy_premium_rules[0]][1] This is calculated as the difference between the scheduled charge for the new total liability and the scheduled charge for the original liability. [general_principles_and_rules.increased_liability_calculation[0]][1]

## 4. Lender Policy Engine — Stand-Alone, Concurrent, and Refi Shortcuts

Lender's policy premiums, detailed in Chapter III of the manual, are highly dependent on the transaction scenario. Correctly identifying the scenario is crucial, as it can reduce the premium by more than half compared to a misclassified transaction. [lenders_policy_premium_rules[0]][2]

| Scenario | Policy Type | Rate Basis | Key Eligibility / Conditions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Standalone Loan** (No Owner's Policy) [lenders_policy_premium_rules[0]][2] | Standard Coverage (with WRE) | **80%** of Schedule of Rates | Loan is not issued with a concurrent owner's policy. |
| | Extended Coverage (without WRE) | **90%** of Schedule of Rates | Loan is not issued with a concurrent owner's policy. |
| | ALTA Expanded Coverage | **100%** of Schedule of Rates | Loan is not issued with a concurrent owner's policy. |
| **Concurrent Loan** (With Owner's Policy) [lenders_policy_premium_rules[0]][2] | Standard or Extended Loan (with matching Owner's) | **$150** flat fee | Loan liability cannot exceed owner's policy liability. Excess is charged on an increased liability basis. |
| | Extended Loan (with Standard Owner's) | **100%** of 'Extended Lenders Concurrent Rate' table | Issued when owner's policy is standard but lender requires extended. |
| | ALTA Expanded Loan (with Standard Owner's) | **100%** of 'Extended Lenders Concurrent Rate' + **10%** of 'Schedule of Rates' | Highest cost scenario for mismatched coverage. |
| **Residential Refinance** [lenders_policy_premium_rules[0]][2] | ALTA Extended Coverage Loan | Specific 'Residential Refinance Rate' table | Applies to 1-4 family residential refinances. Cannot be for acquisition or construction. |
| **Centralized Loan** [lenders_policy_premium_rules[0]][2] | ALTA Loan Policy | Specific 'Centralized Loan Rate' tables (I or II) | Requires prior written TRGC approval and use of a centralized electronic platform. Not for acquisition/construction. |
| **Disaster Area Loan** [lenders_policy_premium_rules[0]][2] | Any Loan Policy | **50%** of the applicable rate | Loan is for repair/reconstruction in a declared disaster area; policy must be issued within 24 months of declaration. |
| **Multiple Loans** [lenders_policy_premium_rules[0]][2] | Multiple policies on same property | Aggregate loan amount at applicable rate + **$150** for each policy over one | For multiple loans to the same borrower on the same property. |
| **Junior Loan** [lenders_policy_premium_rules[0]][2] | ALTA Residential Limited Coverage Junior Loan | Tiered flat fees ($105 - $205) | For subordinate liens up to $400,000. |
| **Mortgage Modification** [lenders_policy_premium_rules[0]][2] | ALTA Residential Limited Coverage Mortgage Modification | Tiered flat fees ($125 - $350+) | For modifying existing mortgages. |

**Key Takeaway**: The choice between a standalone policy and a concurrent one is the most significant pricing decision. A concurrent standard loan policy is a flat **$150**, whereas a standalone equivalent could cost thousands, making bundling a critical sales and quoting strategy. [lenders_policy_premium_rules[0]][2]

## 5. Construction & Future Financing Toolkit

The TRGC manual provides specific rules for construction-related financing in Chapter III, sections 9 through 12. Pricing hinges on whether an owner's policy is issued concurrently and whether the financing is initial or a reissue. [construction_related_premium_rules[0]][1]

### Initial Construction Loan Policy (Chapter III-9)
The premium for insuring the initial construction loan varies by coverage:
* **Standard Coverage Construction Loan**:
 * Without a concurrent owner's policy: **75% of the Schedule of Rates**. [construction_related_premium_rules[0]][1]
 * With a concurrent owner's policy (full value): **$150**. [construction_related_premium_rules[0]][1]
* **Extended Coverage Construction Loan**:
 * Without a concurrent owner's policy: **85% of the Schedule of Rates**. [construction_related_premium_rules[0]][1]
 * With a concurrent owner's policy (full value): **100% of the Extended Lenders Concurrent Rate**. [construction_related_premium_rules[0]][1]
 * With a concurrent owner's policy (NOT full value): **90% of the Schedule of Rates**. [construction_related_premium_rules[0]][1]

### Construction Reissue Loan Policy (Chapter III-10)
When a construction loan is replaced by permanent financing for the same borrower within two years of work completion, a discounted reissue rate applies. [construction_related_premium_rules[0]][1]
* Standard to Standard: **25%** of Schedule of Rates. [construction_related_premium_rules[0]][1]
* Standard to Extended: **50%** of Schedule of Rates. [construction_related_premium_rules[0]][1]
* Extended to Extended: **35%** of Schedule of Rates. [construction_related_premium_rules[0]][1]
* Any liability on the new policy exceeding the original is charged on an increased liability basis. [construction_related_premium_rules[0]][1]

### Binders and Construction Loan Packages
* **Binder to Insure Future Financing (Chapter III-11)**: Issued with an owner's policy to lock in a rate for a future loan. The charge is the standard concurrent lender's rate plus an additional **10% of the Schedule of Rates** for a one-year binder or **20%** for a two-year binder. [construction_related_premium_rules[0]][1]
* **Construction Loan Package (LP 10) (Chapter III-12)**: This package for construction-to-permanent financing issues an initial Extended Coverage loan policy at the **Basic Rate**, and the reissued permanent loan policy is charged at **40% of the Basic Insurance Rate**. [construction_related_premium_rules[0]][1]

**Key Takeaway**: Time is money. The two-year window for reissue rates is a hard deadline. Missing it means the borrower pays a full new premium instead of saving up to 75% on the reissued policy.

## 6. Development Scale Pricing — Major Projects & Subdivisions

For large-scale commercial, industrial, or land developments, TRGC's manual shifts away from standard rate calculations to two specialized pricing models found in Chapters VI and VII.

### Major Projects (Chapter VI)
This pricing model applies to transactions meeting high liability thresholds and uses a "per thousand" rate structure instead of a percentage of the Schedule of Rates. [major_projects_and_subdivision_pricing[0]][2]

* **Applicability**: Applies to transactions with a single policy of **$2,000,000+** or an aggregate liability of **$3,000,000+**. [major_projects_and_subdivision_pricing[0]][2]
* **Negotiable Pricing**: For deals with an aggregate liability of **$20,000,000 or more**, pricing for both title and escrow services can be negotiated. This requires **prior review and written approval from Company Underwriting Counsel**. [major_projects_and_subdivision_pricing[0]][2]
* **Rate Structure**: The premium is calculated by aggregating the liability of all policies, finding the corresponding bracket, and applying the specified rate per $1,000 of liability. [major_projects_and_subdivision_pricing[0]][2] Rates decrease as liability increases. For example, Owner's Insurance rates range from $0.60 to $0.70 per $1,000. [major_projects_and_subdivision_pricing[0]][2]

### Subdivision Pricing (Chapter VII)
This model is for developments with individual policy liabilities under the Major Project threshold and applies a percentage discount to the standard 'Schedule of Rates'. [major_projects_and_subdivision_pricing[0]][2]

* **Applicability**: Applies to commercial, industrial, or land development projects where individual policy liabilities are **less than $2,000,000**. [major_projects_and_subdivision_pricing[0]][2]
* **Rate Structure**: A percentage is applied to the standard 'Schedule of Rates'.
 * New Home Subdivision Owner's Policies: **75% of Schedule of Rates**. [major_projects_and_subdivision_pricing[0]][2]
 * Subdivided Land Acquisition Owner's Policies: **55% (Standard)** or **65% (Extended)** of Schedule of Rates. [major_projects_and_subdivision_pricing[0]][2]
 * Construction Loans: **30% (Standard)** or **45% (Extended)** of Schedule of Rates. [major_projects_and_subdivision_pricing[0]][2]
 * Additional loan policies in any subdivision scenario are charged a flat **$200 each**. [major_projects_and_subdivision_pricing[0]][2]

| Feature | Major Projects (Chapter VI) | Subdivision Pricing (Chapter VII) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Liability Threshold** | Single policy ≥ $2M or Aggregate ≥ $3M | Individual policies < $2M |
| **Pricing Model** | Rate per $1,000 of aggregate liability | Percentage of 'Schedule of Rates' |
| **Negotiability** | Yes, for aggregate liability ≥ $20M (with counsel approval) | No, rates are fixed percentages |
| **Example Rate** | $0.60 - $0.70 per $1,000 for Owner's Insurance | 55% - 75% of Schedule of Rates for Owner's Policies |

**Key Takeaway**: The $2M liability threshold is a critical inflection point. Crossing it flips the entire pricing model from a percentage-based discount to a per-thousand calculation and opens the door for negotiation on very large deals.

## 7. Endorsement Profit & Risk Grid

Endorsements are a key component of the total premium, offering both enhanced coverage for the client and a significant revenue opportunity. Charges can be flat fees, percentages of the Schedule of Rates, or waived entirely. Failure to correctly identify and charge for percentage-based endorsements is a common source of lost revenue.

The following table highlights several high-impact endorsements from Chapter VIII of the manual.

| Form Number | Endorsement Name | Applicable Policies | Charge Amount / Basis | Audit Flag / Common Miss |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CLTA 3.1 / ALTA 123.1** | Zoning - Unimproved Land | Owner or Lender (ALTA) | **10%** of Schedule of Rates (min $100) [endorsement_guide_and_fees.6.charge_amount[0]][3] | Missed minimum charge on low-liability policies. |
| **CLTA 3.2 / ALTA 123.2** | Zoning, Improved Land | Owner or Lender (ALTA) | **10% to 15%** of Schedule of Rates (min $100), or per-lot fee for tracts. [endorsement_guide_and_fees.7.charge_amount[0]][3] | Failure to check for prior issuance of 3.1, resulting in undercharge. |
| **CLTA 3.3 / ALTA 123.3** | Zoning-Land Under Development | Owner and Lender (Extended) | **15% to 30%** of Schedule of Rates (min $100), varies by policy. [endorsement_guide_and_fees.8.charge_amount[0]][2] | Applying the wrong percentage for the specific policy type (Owner vs. Lender, Standard vs. Extended). |
| **CLTA 100.1** | Restrictions, Encroachments & Minerals | Owner/Lender: Standard | **25% to 30%** of Schedule of Rates. [endorsement_guide_and_fees.9.charge_amount[0]][3] | Often overlooked on standard policies, representing lost upsell revenue. |
| **ALTA 9-06** | Restrictions, Encroachments, Minerals-Loan | Lender: ALTA | **No Charge** [endorsement_guide_and_fees.10.charge_amount[0]][2] | Incorrectly adding a charge when it should be included. |
| **CLTA 104.1-06** | Assignment of Mortgage | Lender: ALTA | Varies: **$125 flat fee**, **20% of unpaid balance**, or **No Charge** if concurrent. [endorsement_guide_and_fees.13.charge_amount[0]][2] | Failure to apply the correct conditional logic (vested owner, concurrency). |
| **CLTA 116-06** | Designation of Improvements, Address | Lender: ALTA | **No Charge** if concurrent, **10% of Schedule of Rates** if subsequent. [endorsement_guide_and_fees.14.charge_amount[0]][2] | Charging for the endorsement when it is issued concurrently with the policy. |
| **ALTA 33-06 / CLTA 138-06** | Disbursement | Lender: ALTA | **$250.00** flat fee. [endorsement_guide_and_fees.17.charge_amount[0]][2] | Forgetting to add this flat fee during construction draws. |
| **ALTA 149-06** | Option | ALTA Owner | **$500.00** flat fee. | Standard flat fee, easy to capture. |
| **ALTA 150-06** | Solar | Lender | **$100.00** flat fee. [endorsement_guide_and_fees.1.charge_amount[0]][2] | Standard flat fee, easy to capture. |
| **Form JR1** | Supplemental Coverage (Junior Loan) | ALTA Jr. Loan Policy | **No charge** for first within 6 months, otherwise **$25.00**. [endorsement_guide_and_fees.4.charge_amount[0]][2] | Missing the 6-month cutoff and failing to charge the fee. |
| **ALTA 41.3-06 / CLTA 143.3-06** | Water - Land Under Development | Owner and Lender | **15% to 25%** of Schedule of Rates (max $350-$750). [endorsement_guide_and_fees.19.charge_amount[0]][2] | Not applying the maximum charge cap on high-liability policies. |

**Key Takeaway**: While many endorsements are "No Charge" or simple flat fees, percentage-based endorsements like Zoning and Restrictions can add up to 30% of the base rate to the premium. [endorsement_guide_and_fees.8.charge_amount[0]][2] Automating the pricing logic for these endorsements is the fastest way to prevent revenue leakage.

## 8. Escrow & Other Transactional Fees — Transparent Client Billing

In addition to the title insurance premium, the final client invoice will include a variety of separate charges for escrow and other transactional services. These fees are detailed in Chapter IV and other sections of the manual and must be itemized separately from the premium.

### Core Transactional Charges
These are flat fees applied on a per-transaction or per-item basis.
* **Electronic Recording Charge**: **$25.00** per transaction for the electronic filing of documents. [other_transactional_charges.0.fee_amount[0]][1]
* **Reconveyance Charge**: **$45.00** to transfer title from a beneficiary back to the borrower (trustor) after a loan is paid off. [other_transactional_charges.1.fee_amount[0]][3]
* **Additional Parcel Fee**: **$75.00** for each parcel over one. [other_transactional_charges.2.fee_amount[0]][1] A reduced minimum charge of **$50.00** applies for non-abutting parcels in different tracts but under the same owner. [other_transactional_charges.3.fee_amount[0]][1]

### Escrow Fees Schedule (Chapter IV)
TRGC provides a detailed schedule for escrow services, with fees varying by the transaction type and complexity.

| Service Name | Fee Basis & Structure | Key Conditions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sale Without A Loan** | Tiered fee based on sale price (e.g., $450 up to $100k, $1,600 over $1.25M). [escrow_fees_schedule.0.fee_amount_or_structure[0]][1] | Applies to sale transactions that do not involve a loan. |
| **Sale With 1-2 Loans** | 'Sale Without A Loan' fee + **$300**. | Applies to sale transactions involving one or two loans. |
| **Residential Refinance** | Tiered fee based on loan amount ($285 up to $50k, $450 over $250k). [escrow_fees_schedule.4.fee_amount_or_structure[0]][1] | Applies to residential refinances not used for property acquisition. [escrow_fees_schedule.4.conditions[0]][1] |
| **Short Sale Add-On** | Standard sale escrow fee + **$400**. [escrow_fees_schedule.6.fee_amount_or_structure[0]][1] | Applies when total payoffs exceed the property's sale price. |
| **Construction Loan Add-On** | Standard sale escrow fee + **$500-$600** based on number of disbursements. | Applies to construction loan transactions. |
| **Document Preparation** | **$50.00** per document. | Charged when not included in a service package. |
| **Wire Transfers** | **$25.00** per wire. | Charged when the number of included wires is exceeded. |
| **1031 Exchange** | **$200.00** flat fee. | Charged as an additional escrow service. |
| **SBA Loan** | **$200.00** flat fee. [escrow_fees_schedule.12.fee_amount_or_structure[0]][1] | Charged as an additional escrow service. |

**Key Takeaway**: Clearly separating and itemizing these non-premium fees on client estimates and closing statements is essential for transparency and helps prevent disputes over "junk fees."

## 9. Guarantees & Specialty Products — 11 Forms, 4 Pricing Models

Beyond standard policies, TRGC offers a suite of guarantee products, each with its own CLTA form number, liability limit, and unique pricing model. These are not based on simple multipliers but involve flat fees, per-item charges, hourly rates, or percentages of the Schedule of Rates.

| Guarantee Name | Form | Pricing Model | Charge Details | Liability Limit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trustee's Sale Guarantee** | CLTA 22 | % of Schedule of Rates | 80% of Schedule of Rates based on unpaid loan balance. | Unpaid loan balance |
| **Litigation Guarantee** | CLTA 1 | % of Schedule of Rates | 100% of Schedule of Rates (min $500). | Value of estate |
| **Subdivision Guarantee** | CLTA 14 | Flat + Per-Item | $150 + $20 per interest reported. | $10,000 |
| **Parcel Map Guarantee (Final)** | CLTA 23 | Flat + Per-Item | $250 + $50 per interest. Fee is only $50 if a prelim was issued. | $10,000 |
| **Limited Trustee's Sale** | N/A | Flat Fee Package | $350 (inclusive) or $225 (non-inclusive). | Up to $250,000 |
| **Judgment & Tax Lien** | N/A | Complex Calculation | Min $400, Max $1000, based on per-name and per-lien charges. | Not specified |
| **Condition of Title** | CLTA 28 | Flat Fee Per Parcel | $500 for first parcel, $400 for each additional. | $10,000 |
| **Mechanic's Lien** | CLTA 9 | Flat + Per-Lien | $75 per parcel + $5 for each lien over two. | Fee paid, rounded to next $100 |
| **Personal Property** | CLTA 11 | Per Name/Per Year | $35 per name/year (min $100). | Fee paid, rounded to next $100 |
| **Lot Book Guarantee** | CLTA 12 | Flat Fee (Long/Short) | Long: $250/parcel. Short: $50/parcel. | Not specified |
| **Plant Information** | CLTA 17 | Hourly Rate | $50/hr searching, $20/hr processing (min $70). | Not specified |
| **Recorded Document** | CLTA 27 | Varies (Open Order) | Hourly ($100/hr, min $1k) or Tiered Flat Fee ($250-$550). | $10k or up to $25k |

**Key Takeaway**: Guarantees are specialized, high-margin products. Understanding the distinct pricing logic for each—especially the difference between percentage-based (Trustee's Sale) and flat-fee/per-item (Subdivision, Parcel Map)—is essential for accurate quoting.

## 10. Compliance & Audit Safeguards — 15-Point Checklist

Adherence to the TRGC rate manual is a matter of regulatory compliance. This checklist outlines critical operational steps to ensure every calculation is accurate and auditable, based on the manual effective September 1, 2025.

#### **1. Regulatory Compliance & Core Principles**
* **[ ] CDI Filing Compliance:** Confirm all calculations adhere to the TRGC manual filed with the California Department of Insurance (CDI) per **California Insurance Code Section 12401**. [compliance_and_operations_checklist[0]][1]
* **[ ] Applicability Date:** Verify the application or order date is on or after **September 1, 2025**. The manual's rates do not apply to earlier applications. [calculation_summary[0]][1]
* **[ ] Excess Rates Agreement (CIC § 12401.8):** If charging rates higher than the manual for unusual risks, ensure a written agreement is in place with the payer *before* services are rendered. [compliance_and_operations_checklist[0]][1]

#### **2. Insured Amount & Fair Value Determination (Manual Section I-2)**
* **[ ] Determine Fair Value:**
 * If a sale is involved, the insured amount must not be less than the **sale price**. [calculation_summary[0]][1]
 * If no sale is involved, the insured amount must not be less than the **sum of all recorded voluntary monetary encumbrances**. [calculation_summary[0]][1]
* **[ ] Approval for Excess Value:** If the insured amount exceeds fair value, obtain and document **prior approval from Title Resources (TRGC)**. [step_by_step_calculation_guide[0]][1]

#### **3. Preliminary Report & Cancellation Fees (Manual Section I-3 & CIC § 12404.1)**
* **[ ] Preliminary Report Charge:** The charge must be reasonably related to production costs but **not less than the minimum liability rate for a Standard Owner's Policy**. [compliance_and_operations_checklist[0]][1]
* **[ ] Cancellation Fee:** If the order is cancelled, the Preliminary Report charge becomes the cancellation fee. [compliance_and_operations_checklist[0]][1]
* **[ ] Credit Application:** A credit for a paid Preliminary Report can be applied to a new policy only if issued within **24 months** and there has been **no substantive change in title**. [general_principles_and_rules.preliminary_report_rules[0]][1]

#### **4. Calculation Mechanics & Rounding Rules (Manual Section I-4)**
* **[ ] Liability Amount Rounding:** For rate lookup, round any fractional liability amount **UP** to the next multiple of $10,000. [step_by_step_calculation_guide[0]][1]
* **[ ] Percentage Calculation Rounding:** When calculating a percentage of a rate, round the result **UP** to the next whole dollar. [step_by_step_calculation_guide[0]][1]
* **[ ] Final Result Rounding:** Only round the **final result UP** to the nearest whole dollar. [step_by_step_calculation_guide[0]][1]
* **[ ] Minimum Charge Application (Manual Section I-6):** Ensure the final premium is not less than the minimum charge on the Schedule of Rates. [step_by_step_calculation_guide[0]][1]

#### **5. Decision Logic & Special Rate Application**
* **[ ] Concurrent Issuance:** Apply specific concurrent rates (e.g., flat fees or the Extended Lenders Concurrent Rate table) when an Owner's and Lender's policy are issued simultaneously. [lenders_policy_premium_rules[0]][2]
* **[ ] Centralized Loan Rate:** Confirm prior written approval from TRGC is on file before applying Centralized Loan Rates. [lenders_policy_premium_rules[0]][2]
* **[ ] Major Projects:** If a transaction meets the Major Projects threshold (≥ $2M single policy or ≥ $3M aggregate), flag for special pricing. If aggregate liability is ≥ $20M, flag for mandatory Underwriting Counsel approval for any negotiated rates. [major_projects_and_subdivision_pricing[0]][2]
* **[ ] Increased Liability:** Calculate the charge as the *difference between the scheduled charge for the new amount and the scheduled charge for the original amount*. [general_principles_and_rules.increased_liability_calculation[0]][1]

## 11. Worked Examples & Template Calculator

The following examples illustrate the end-to-end calculation process for common scenarios.

### Example 1: Arm's-Length Resale with ALTA Owner's Policy (Extended Coverage)
* **Inputs**: A property is sold for $550,000. The buyer requests an ALTA Owner's Policy without Western Regional Exceptions (Extended Coverage). The transaction involves a single parcel and requires electronic recording. [worked_calculation_examples.0.scenario_inputs[0]][1]
* **Calculation Steps**:
 1. The liability amount is the sale price of $550,000. This is rounded up to the next $10,000 increment, which is $560,000. [worked_calculation_examples.0.calculation_steps[0]][1]
 2. The base rate for $560,000 is looked up in the 'Schedule of Rates'. (Assumed to be $1,600 for this example). [worked_calculation_examples.0.calculation_steps[0]][1]
 3. The multiplier for an ALTA Owner's Policy without WRE (Extended Coverage) is 125%. [worked_calculation_examples.0.calculation_steps[0]][1]
 4. The premium is calculated as $1,600 * 1.25 = $2,000. [worked_calculation_examples.0.calculation_steps[0]][1]
* **Calculated Premium**: **$2,000.00** [worked_calculation_examples.0.calculated_premium[0]][1]
* **Total Transaction Cost**: $2,000.00 (Premium) + $25.00 (E-Recording) = **$2,025.00** [worked_calculation_examples.0.total_transaction_cost[0]][1]

### Example 2: Residential Refinance with ALTA Extended Coverage Loan Policy
* **Inputs**: A refinance transaction for a $400,000 loan on an improved 1-4 family residential property. The borrower requests an ALTA Extended Coverage Loan Policy. The transaction requires electronic recording and one reconveyance. [worked_calculation_examples.2.scenario_inputs[0]][2]
* **Calculation Steps**:
 1. This transaction qualifies for the 'Residential Refinance Rate' under Section III-4, which has its own specific rate table. [worked_calculation_examples.2.calculation_steps[0]][2]
 2. The loan amount is $400,000. [worked_calculation_examples.2.calculation_steps[0]][2]
 3. Looking up $400,000 in the Residential Refinance Rate Table shows a flat premium of $850.00. [worked_calculation_examples.2.calculation_steps[0]][2]
 4. This rate includes customarily issued endorsements at no additional charge. [worked_calculation_examples.2.calculation_steps[0]][2]
* **Calculated Premium**: **$850.00** [worked_calculation_examples.2.calculated_premium[0]][2]
* **Total Transaction Cost**: $850.00 (Premium) + $25.00 (E-Recording) + $45.00 (Reconveyance) = **$920.00** [worked_calculation_examples.2.total_transaction_cost[0]][1]

### Example 3: Concurrent Standard Coverage Owner's and Loan Policies
* **Inputs**: A property is sold for $500,000 with a new loan of $750,000. The buyer requests a Standard Coverage Owner's Policy ($500k), and the lender requests a concurrent Standard Coverage Loan Policy ($750k). [worked_calculation_examples.3.scenario_inputs[0]][2]
* **Calculation Steps**:
 1. **Owner's Policy Premium:** Liability is $500,000. The rate is 100% of the Schedule of Rates. The base rate for $500,000 is $1,571. Premium is **$1,571**. [worked_calculation_examples.3.calculation_steps[0]][1]
 2. **Loan Policy Premium:** Per Section III-2, a concurrent Standard Loan Policy has a base charge of **$150**. Since the loan ($750k) exceeds the owner's policy ($500k), an increased liability charge applies. This is the difference between the scheduled charge for $750k ($1,973) and $500k ($1,571), which is **$402**. [worked_calculation_examples.3.calculation_steps[0]][1]
 3. The total Loan Policy premium is $150 (base) + $402 (increase) = **$552**. [worked_calculation_examples.3.calculation_steps[0]][1]
 4. **Total Premium:** The combined premium is $1,571 (Owner's) + $552 (Loan) = **$2,123**. [worked_calculation_examples.3.calculation_steps[0]][1]
* **Calculated Premium**: **$2,123.00** [worked_calculation_examples.3.calculated_premium[0]][1]
* **Total Transaction Cost**: $2,123.00 (Premium) + $25.00 (E-Recording) = **$2,148.00** [worked_calculation_examples.3.total_transaction_cost[0]][1]

### Example 4: Standalone Construction Loan (Standard Coverage)
* **Inputs**: A borrower takes out a $1,000,000 construction loan. No owner's policy is being issued concurrently. A Standard Coverage Loan Policy is requested. [worked_calculation_examples.4.scenario_inputs[0]][2]
* **Calculation Steps**:
 1. This transaction falls under Section III-9 for Construction Loans. [worked_calculation_examples.4.calculation_steps[0]][1]
 2. The rate for a Standard Coverage Loan Policy issued without a concurrent owner's policy is 75% of the Schedule of Rates. [worked_calculation_examples.4.calculation_steps[0]][1]
 3. The liability is $1,000,000. The base rate from the Schedule of Rates for $1,000,000 is $2,393. [worked_calculation_examples.4.calculation_steps[0]][1]
 4. The premium is $2,393 * 0.75 = $1,794.75. [worked_calculation_examples.4.calculation_steps[0]][1]
 5. The final premium is rounded up to the next whole dollar, resulting in $1,795. [worked_calculation_examples.4.calculation_steps[0]][1]
* **Calculated Premium**: **$1,795.00** [worked_calculation_examples.4.calculated_premium[0]][1]
* **Total Transaction Cost**: $1,795.00 (Premium) + $25.00 (E-Recording) = **$1,820.00** [worked_calculation_examples.4.total_transaction_cost[0]][1]

## 12. Implementation Roadmap — Automate, Train, Monitor

Successfully navigating TRGC's rate structure requires a systematic approach focused on embedding rules into workflows, training staff on key decision points, and monitoring for compliance and profitability.

### Phase 1: System Configuration & Automation (Months 1-2)
* **Automate Rounding Rules**: Configure quoting software to automatically apply the three-tier rounding rules for liability, percentages, and final premiums.
* **Build a Decision Tree for Special Rates**: Implement an automated workflow that flags transactions eligible for Residential Refinance, Centralized Loan, and Disaster Area rates, prompting the user for required documentation.
* **Pre-populate Endorsement Pricing**: Link the endorsement selection tool directly to the rate engine, auto-calculating charges for both flat-fee and percentage-based endorsements to eliminate manual errors and revenue leakage.
* **Embed Compliance Hard Stops**: Create mandatory approval gates in the system for insuring above Fair Value, using Centralized Loan Rates, or negotiating Major Project pricing. The file should not proceed without an uploaded approval memo.

### Phase 2: Staff Enablement & Training (Month 3)
* **Focus on High-Impact Scenarios**: Conduct training sessions centered on the most valuable and riskiest scenarios: concurrent policy bundling, construction reissue windows, and Major Project thresholds.
* **Develop "Cheat Sheets"**: Create one-page reference guides for the Owner's Policy Matrix, Lender Policy Engine, and Endorsement Grid for quick reference.
* **Role-Play Quoting Sessions**: Run interactive sessions where staff must quote complex scenarios, such as a concurrent loan with mismatched extended coverage or a D.V.A. reconveyance, to build muscle memory.

### Phase 3: KPI Auditing & Monitoring (Months 4-6)
* **Track Quote vs. Final Invoice Variance**: Monitor the percentage of files where the final invoice differs from the initial quote to identify systemic rounding or fee application errors.
* **Audit Endorsement Capture Rate**: Run monthly reports to compare endorsements issued against charges collected, specifically targeting high-value percentage-based endorsements.
* **Monitor Special Rate Usage**: Audit a sample of files using special rate tables to ensure eligibility documentation (e.g., disaster declarations, TRGC approvals) is present and valid. The goal is to reduce the error rate from an industry average of 8% to below 1% within six months.
